
It seems as though little happened this past week in class, but the load outside of class was quite the contrary with the completion of another assignment. This week, we implemented our own vector class that had the ability to utilize the standard allocator built in the c++ library OR our custom defined allocator (by utilizing function defaults/parameters). We also submitted our third project, which was to implement a unique memory allocator. Looking back on it, I would say it was an extremely fun and rewarding project to tackle. The only regret is that I wish I had more time to refine my code to make it more cohesive.

With the submission of one project comes the release of another. Our next upcoming project is called "Darwin", which will contain a grid of "Creatures" that will move about the board given sets of instructions and directionality. I am extremely excited about this project, because it is the first time this semester we are taking a dive into Object Oriented design concepts and practicing them.


**Tip of the Week**

Well, it happened. I missed my first OOP class of the semester this past Wednesday. And if you miss one of Downing's classes, please, please, remember to look over his notes for that day. Else, you will end up missing out on 2 days, because you will be playing catch up trying to learn new material.
