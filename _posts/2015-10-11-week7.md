Last week, although stressful, ended in triumph. Monday and Wednesday's lectures consisted of reviewing material. We went over iterable classes and 'const' variables in c++, concepts which were a great segue into topics that would be covered on the midterm.

The midterm itself, although not easy, was a fair test. If you reviewed all material Downing had previously taught, gave a good 6-8 hours of study time, and followed his suggestion on practicing writing code, then you would do fine. The test was heavy on understanding algorithms and iterators. Studying wise (for future Downing students), I would suggest the following: implement all of the algorithms on the study guide he posts, practice writing stacks/queues, and write your own iterator class.

Next week marks new territory: building a memory allocator. To be continued .....

**Tip of the Week**

Studying for a test is best done not by yourself, but with a group. If you aren't fully grasping a topic, or overlook errors in code you have written, it's great to have a second hand/eye to help you out. Counter to that, if you feel you fully understand something, then give it a whirl and further solidify your understanding by helping someone out. 

So, for future Downing students, form a group, even if it is over Google Hangouts/Docs. You'll be thankful for any help you can get come test time.
