Week four down and Project 2 underway.

**Tip of the Week**

I discovered something pretty cool this week while reading up on a C++ Reference/Guide. C++ has a built in goto method that can jump between statements. Because of this, ironically, you can insert a http url link within your code and it will actually compile (with a warning of course). 
	
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main() {
        	http://www.facebook.com
        	cout << Hello World << endl;
	}

This is because the syntax of goto statements have a colon after the label. So, in the above case, the http: is the goto statement, and the //www.facebook.com is a comment.

I guess this isn't really a tip, just something nerdy cool.
