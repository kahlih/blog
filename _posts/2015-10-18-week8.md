Another week in OOP has come in gone. This past week, our lectures focused on understanding our next project (building an allocator), function defaults, and implementing a vector class similar to the C++ std::vector. The memory allocator we are builing is unique, because everything will be allocated on the stack, as opposed to the std::allocator where everything is managed on the heap. This custom-defined allocator will have have a set size, and allocations will be marked off by utilizing sentinals. Sentinals of negative value represent 'taken' space, where as sentinals of positive value represent 'free' space that is available to be allocated (picture provided below).

I believe the hardest part of this project will be handling the math associated with all cases, escpecially coalescing space when freeing chunks of memory.

Test scores came back this week, and I'm pleased with my grade. It's nice to know that countless hours of writing c++ code paid off.


**Tip of the Week**

Building a custom class comes with building your own constructor, and often times there can be multiple variations of constructors (ie: default constructor, 1 argument constructor, 2 argument constructor, etc...). In these cases, as opposed to explicitly writing out x number of constructors, write one definition with function defaults in the parameter fields to handle constructors that have fewer parameters. This comes with many benifits: less code, unification, and simplified code review/reading.
