This week was the conclusion of our third project: Darwin. 

**Tip of the Week**
Downing emphasizes writing tests before you implement your program. I've always done quite the opposite, and it ended up biting us in the butt this week upon project submission. Once I designed some tests, I realized there were errors in our 'what we believed to be' finished program. End result was, we spent many hours bashing our heads trying to understand what was wrong. Now my general rule of thumb: write tests first, and catch the problem early.
