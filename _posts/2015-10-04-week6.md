The topics covered this week in OOP consisted of writing more C++ std algorithms, learning lambda expressions (and the respective synatx), and implementing iterators and iterable containers.

Lambda expressions are the most obscure to me at the moment (which is why I am going to write about them now to gain the familiarity I'm lacking). Lambda expressions are a way of encapsulating a function right at the location it is envoked, as well as any local variables it utilizes. I can see many benefits using them, one being convenience. You can declare a method in the same place you are going to use it. It saves the overhead of having to declare a new function, especially if it will only be used once.

**Tip of the Week**

GitHub's Gists are a great way to create random code snippets and host them online. What I have also found is that they are a great way to study for tests. Here is a code snippet of a custom stack I am creating. It might be helpful to study for the test: https://gist.github.com/kahlih/d8692e1b58376974aa0b
